# Machine Learning Projects 

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of basic machine-learning projects. Each project demonstrates fundamental concepts and techniques in machine learning, ranging from data preprocessing to model evaluation. These projects I undertook during the IBM ML courses on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-machine-learning).

## Projects Included

- **Project 1: Supervised Classification of Cancerous Tumours**
  - This project focuses on identifying which growths are cancerous based on their physical properties. The dataset includes various features describing the tumors, and the goal is to classify them accurately.
  - **Key Techniques:** Data preprocessing, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Bagging, Random Forests, and Stacking.

- **Project 2: Unsupervised Classification of Iris Species**
  - This project involves the classification of different species of the Iris genus using unsupervised learning techniques. The dataset includes measurements of iris flowers, and the objective is to group them into species without prior labels.
  - **Key Techniques:** Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering.

- **Project 3: Computer Vision to Classify Numbers in the MNIST Dataset**
  - This project applies computer vision techniques to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The goal is to develop models that can accurately recognize and classify each digit.
  - **Key Techniques:** Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
